# trython
A transpiler for a static typed python dialect
This project is focused on functional python, so the use of classes are not yet implmented. All python libraries are on , and can be imported ( given that 
all commands will be transpiled ) 

A trython code example is written at 'compiled_text_2.txt' and can be used as an example to test the system in your machine.
